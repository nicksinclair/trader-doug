# Trader Doug

A stock tracking and news app that I created for my dad (_the_ Trader Doug himself).

## Background

I created this app as a way to learn more about the [Polygon.io stocks and reference data API](https://polygon.io/stocks).

This was inspired by my dad, who is a CPA that frequently checks how individual stocks are performing using a variety of different sources. I wanted to create an experience that allowed him to specify tickers and view the data in an easy to read format.

## Features

- View daily aggregate stock data in a chart or table format
- Select specific tickers to view on your dashboard
- Filter daily aggregates by date range
- Access news articles about each stock

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicksinclair/trader-doug.git
cd trader-doug
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
